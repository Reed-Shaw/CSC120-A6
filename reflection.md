- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I really like it! This is a concept that makes sense to me easily I think. I like the way you can start with building blocks and specialize as needed. I think I would have a hard time deciding what to make as part of my parent funciton and what to leave for later though. Sometimes I can't tell what everything has in common until I've done all my code. ("But Reed", I hear you say, "this is why you should sketch out your code before typing it." But I wont. The thoughts don't think in that order. I appreciate the sentiment though.)
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Definitely using the methods that were apready built into ArrayLists and Hashtables was very helpful. I had a really hard time working with the hashtables though beucase I'd never encountered them before. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html was very helpful for this problem but also I couldn't figure out how one would ask for keys with a certain kind of value or get just one key or just one value if you didn't already know what it was.
